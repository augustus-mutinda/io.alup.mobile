# Android Technical Assessment, Alup.
# Question 1.
## Problem Statement.
Kenyan Farmers often suffer losses or low farm yields due to a diverse range of catastrophies, this may range from floods, drought, etc. This affects millions of families essentially due to lack of farm insurance for the small scale farmer.
## Problem Proof/Justification
Right now, March 2023, farmers in lower eastern Kenya are in Anguish due to prolonged drought which has lowered crop yields while Farmers in Western Kenya, in Kisumu/Migori are at a loss after a hail storm destroyed their Rice Crop. Alup should provide a medium for insurance providers to fetch a new market (small scale farmers) and the farmers will have some level of protection.
## Why Alup?
Africa is the most affected region/continent by Climate change and while efforts are being made to reverse the effects, it will take time.
Due to this, all stakeholders should come together and have some level of security on farming business, otherwise the situation will only become dire.
## How to measure success?
### Adoption by Farmers
The more the farmers the platform has, the better since the insurance will only get cheaper.
### Adoption by Insurance providers
More insurance providers will promote healthy competition, this in. turn will self propel the solution.

## Task's break down
I have invited peter@pula.io to an atlassian site, and should have access to this jira site, https://alup.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/AM/boards/1. This board has a breakdown on various tasks assigned to various members of the team. The senior engineer take on the heavier tasks while the 2 mid level engineers take up UI tasks, working along side each other. The Junior is tasked with remedial tasks and shadowing the mid level engineers such as UI tests, SITs, UATs and Git set Up.
Preparation to production is done by the senior engineer. The time line is 4 weeks to production, leaving 2 weeks for a pilot phase where any issues can be fixed.
## Tools
### 1. Android Studio
This will be used for primary android development, testing and to production preparation.
### 2. Postman
This will be used for API testing
### 3. Firebase Analytics
This will be used for realtime app metrics Monitoring
### 4. Dynatrace
This will be used to track in the realtime user actions
### 5. Prometheus, Splunk or ELK (Elastic Search, Logstash & Kibana)
These can be used to track and trace logs while providing dashboards
